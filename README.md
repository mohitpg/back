## Image Caption

# Overview
This repository contains an Image Captioning web application developed using Keras and React and deployed using Flask. The project aims to generate descriptive captions for uploaded images using a deep learning model.

# Key Features
<ul>
<li>User-friendly web interface for uploading images.</li>
<li>Backend powered by Flask, enabling seamless communication with the deep learning model.</li>
<li>The deep learning model is built using Keras, leveraging pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) for image feature extraction and caption generation, respectively.</li>
<li>Real-time image processing and caption generation.</li>
<li>Easy-to-understand UI built with React, allowing a smooth user experience.</li>
</ul>

# Installation
1. Run <br>
 `git clone https://github.com/mohitpg/back.git` <br>
2. Go to folder back/backend <br>
3. Run <br>
 ```python -m venv <path>``` <br>
4. Activate <br>
Bash ```source <path>/bin/activate``` <br>
Windows ```<path>\Scripts\activate.bat``` <br>
5. Run <br>
```pip install -r requirements.txt``` <br>
6. Finally run <br>
```python server.py``` <br>
This will run the server at localhost port:5000
