# Overview
This repository contains an Image Captioning web application developed using Keras and React and deployed using Flask. The project aims to generate descriptive captions for uploaded images using a deep learning model.

# Key Features
<ul>
<li>User-friendly web interface for uploading images.</li>
<li>Backend powered by Flask, enabling seamless communication with the deep learning model.</li>
<li>The deep learning model is built using Keras, leveraging pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) for image feature extraction and caption generation, respectively.</li>
<li>Real-time image processing and caption generation.</li>
<li>Easy-to-understand UI built with React, allowing a smooth user experience.</li>
</ul>
